{ "content": "To generate the SQL query to display employees who recorded sales for the months of May and June 2023, we can use the below query in Apache Presto syntax:\n\nsql\nWITH time_dimension_cast AS (\n  SELECT\n    order_id,\n    CAST(order_date AS date) AS order_date,\n    year,\n    quarter,\n    month\n  FROM\n    time_dimension\n)\nSELECT\n  e.emp_id,\n  e.emp_name\nFROM\n  employee_dimension e\nINNER JOIN\n  sales_fact s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id\nINNER JOIN\n  time_dimension_cast t ON s.order_id = t.order_id\nWHERE\n  t.order_date >= date '2023-05-01'\n  AND t.order_date < date '2023-07-01'\n\n\nExplanation:\n- We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `time_dimension_cast` where we cast the `order_date` column of the `time_dimension` table to date format.\n- Then, we select the `emp_id` and `emp_name` columns from the `employee_dimension` table.\n- We join the `sales_fact` table on the `emp_id` column and the `time_dimension_cast` table on the `order_id` column.\n- Finally, we filter the results to only include records with an `order_date` in May and June 2023.\n\nNote: The date format used in the query is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'."
